- File integrity: All system files unchanged

ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS:
1. Service restarts (unsuccessful)
   - Apache: Restarted successfully, no effect
   - MySQL: Restarted successfully, no effect
   - PHP-FPM: Restarted successfully, no effect

2. Database integrity checks (all passed)
   - Table consistency: OK
   - Index integrity: OK
   - Foreign key constraints: OK
   - Data corruption scan: No issues found

3. Network diagnostics (all normal)
   - DNS resolution: Working correctly
   - Port connectivity: All required ports open
   - Bandwidth utilization: Normal levels
   - Packet loss: 0%

4. Configuration validation (no issues)
   - Apache config syntax: Valid
   - PHP configuration: No errors
   - Database configuration: Normal
   - Environment variables: All set correctly

USER REPORTS:
- Multiple complaints of site being "completely down"
- Some users report seeing generic error pages
- Mobile app also affected
- No partial functionality reported
- Error messages inconsistent across browsers

THIRD-PARTY SERVICES:
- Email delivery: Functioning normally
- Payment processor: Operational
- Analytics tracking: Last data received at 6:25 AM
- Backup systems: Running scheduled tasks
- Monitoring alerts: Triggered at 6:30 AM sharp

INFRASTRUCTURE REVIEW:
- Cloud provider status: No reported issues
- DNS provider: All records resolving correctly
- Backup verification: Latest backup from 6:00 AM restored successfully in test environment
- Cache systems: Cleared and rebuilt multiple times
- Session storage: Redis functioning normally

HYPOTHESES BEING INVESTIGATED:
- Possible configuration drift not detected by monitoring
- Intermittent hardware issue not showing in diagnostics
- Edge case in application logic triggered by specific conditions
- Time-based issue (cache expiration, cron jobs, etc.)
- Silent corruption in application files
- Dependency failure not covered by health checks

EXTERNAL CONSULTATION:
- Cloud provider support ticket opened (Ticket #2025-0613-7492)
- Security firm contacted for emergency audit
- Database specialist scheduled for remote review
- Network engineer conducting independent assessment

CURRENT APPROACH:
- Keeping production offline until root cause identified
- Using staging environment to replicate issue
- Systematic elimination of potential causes
- Waiting for external security audit results
- Preparing contingency plans for extended downtime

BUSINESS IMPACT:
- All user-facing services unavailable
- Customer support overwhelmed with inquiries
- Revenue stream completely halted
- Partner integrations disrupted
- Marketing campaigns suspended

COMMUNICATION STRATEGY:
- Generic maintenance message displayed
- Customer support providing standard responses
- Social media acknowledging "technical difficulties"
- No timeline provided to users
- Internal stakeholders updated hourly

NEXT STEPS:
- Complete forensic analysis of system logs
- Interview all team members who had access in past 48 hours
- Review recent code changes (none found so far)
- Test restore procedures on isolated environment
- Prepare for potential complete system rebuild
